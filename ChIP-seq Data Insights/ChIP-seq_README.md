Project Title: ChIP-seq Data Analysis

Overview:
This project entails the analysis of ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) data, focusing on identifying genomic regions bound by proteins of interest. The analysis involves combining multiple BED files, computing basic statistics of peak scores, and visualizing the distribution of peak scores across the genome.

Objectives:

Combine and preprocess ChIP-seq data from multiple BED files.
Calculate basic statistics of peak scores to understand the data distribution.
Visualize the distribution of peak scores and the genomic distribution of peaks per chromosome.
Analyze the width of peaks and explore potential correlations with peak scores.
Methods and Technologies:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Utilized Pandas to load and concatenate BED files, preparing the data for analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Calculated basic statistics of peak scores to gain insights into data distribution.
Data Visualization: Employed Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations depicting the distribution of peak scores and genomic distribution of peaks per chromosome.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Investigated the width of peaks and explored potential correlations with peak scores.
Results:

Basic Statistics of Peak Scores: Descriptive statistics of peak scores reveal insights into the distribution and variability of peak scores.
Distribution of Peaks per Chromosome: Visualization showcases the distribution of peaks across different chromosomes, providing insights into genomic binding patterns.
Peak Score Distribution per Chromosome: Boxplot visualization illustrates the variability of peak scores across chromosomes.
Distribution of Peak Widths: Histogram visualization explores the distribution of peak widths.
Peak Score vs. Peak Width: Scatter plot analysis investigates potential correlations between peak scores and widths.
Conclusions:
This project demonstrates proficiency in handling and analyzing ChIP-seq data using Python and relevant libraries. The analysis provides insights into the genomic distribution and characteristics of peaks, laying the foundation for further exploration and interpretation of ChIP-seq results.
