# Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome to my Bioinformatics Portfolio. This collection represents a selection of my projects within the field, illustrating my capabilities in data analysis, machine learning applications, and genomic research. Each project folder is carefully titled to reflect its contents and includes:

- **Code**: Scripts and notebooks demonstrating my analytical techniques.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts that visually represent the data insights.
- **Project README.md**: A detailed explanation of the project's objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.

This portfolio is designed to showcase my proficiency in bioinformatics and my ability to translate complex biological data into actionable insights.
